Description:
  Implements the Groupwise Truncated Fisher (GTF) score to compute group-level \
  p-values from independant p-values. \
  It is designed as an alternative to Fisher's method, that does not suffer as much \
  from the non uniformity of p-values under the null hypothesis. \
  The API is designed to integrate with the package `dplyr`, \
  and optionally with `progressr`.
